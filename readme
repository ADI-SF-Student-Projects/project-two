The Oakland Up & Down app is a neighborhood guide that allows users to search for locations in
Oakland's Uptown and Downtown neighborhoods.

Users can search by location name, location type (e.g. restaurant, things to do), location subtype (e.g. italian,
climbing gym), and price.

Users can add any location in the app to a list of their favorites.
